jquery plugin that programmatically generates a qr code

It degrades somewhat gracefully showing the text that your qr code was going to generate...

usage:
<script type="text/javascript">
$(document).ready(function() {
	$('.qrcode').jqqr();
});
</script>

<div class="qrcode" rel="500x500">but I don't want to be a pirate</div>
